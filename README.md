# HideActiveWindow

Hides the current active window in Windows to keep snoopers away

## What it does?

- When you launch the script and go to the top left corner `(0,0)` with your mouse or press `F8` key, the current active window will hide itself leaving no trace it.
- To make the window visible, go to the top left corner `(0,0)` or press `F8` again and the window will appear back magically.
- Exit the script by moving the mouse to lower right corner or press `F11`, the script will silently exit and if there was any window hidden, it will close itself silently too.
- Hitting the `F10` key will suspend the tool, that means you need to re-activate it by hitting the `F10` key again to for other hotkeys and mouse triggers to work.

## Installation:

- Simply run `HideActive.exe` and you're ready to keep snoopers away.
- This script is written in `AutoIT`, you can see the source in `HideActive.au3` and make any changes if you want to.
